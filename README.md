# GestureRecognizer
An app to perform gesture recognition using $N recognizer.

### Features
1. Has 3 modes which the user can select namely: Math Symbol Recognizer, Equation Recognizer and $N Recognizer.
2. Math Symbol Recognizer : Recognizes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, (, ), +, -, /, X, ^ as I proposed in the project 2 of the HCIRA class.
3. Equation Recognizer: Letâ€™s user write a whole equation and recognizes it in one go using segmentation logic.
4. $N Recognizer: Recognizes all the 16 symbols present on the [$N](https://depts.washington.edu/acelab/proj/dollar/ndollar.html) website.
5. Highly Extensible: Any set of gestures can be quickly added for recognition just uploading a new template.
